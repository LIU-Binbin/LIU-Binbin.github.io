<!--<h1 class="center">Binbin LIU</h1> -->

Greetings! I graduated with a master's in physics from Beihang University, Beijing, China, with theoretical and computational focuses. I was co-advised by [Prof. Xian-Lei Sheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MDetOEgAAAAJ) at Beihang University and [Prof. Shengyuan A. Yang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Q-eIAcIAAAAJ) at the University of Macau. I completed my bachelor's thesis in [Prof. Chueng Ji](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1004349)'s group at NC State, working on nucleons in light-front dynamics.

My master's research primarily focuses on investigating electronic materials and meta-materials through **first-principles** calculations and theoretical modeling. I am interested in studying **topological** properties, strong **correlation** effects, and **excitations** (in response to light and heat) in novel and experimentally realizable systems such as moiré heterostructures, kagome materials, cold atoms and electric circuits. <!--These areas have significant potential for applications in electronic devices. -->I am also excited about developing/applying electronic structure theory and combining it with state-of-the-art AI to advance our understanding of materials.

<!--development and use of computational methods combining electronic structure and many-body approaches for explaining and predicting properties of materials with strong electronic correlations, and a strong research agenda in the field of quantum materials.-->
