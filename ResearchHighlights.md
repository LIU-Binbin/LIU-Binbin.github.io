## Higher-order Topology in Graphyne Families <br />
{% include image.html url="/assets/research/tbgpy.png" caption="Twisted bilayer α-graphyne" width="180px" align="left" %}
We identified twisted bilayer α-graphyne and γ-graphyne as second-order topological insulators in 2D and real Chern insulators with higher-order hinge states in 3D, respectively, using combined first-principles calculations and theoretical modeling. The γ-graphyne is the first predicted 3D real Chern insulator material. We demonstrated the origin of higher-order topological states in these materials through effective moiré magnetism or Zeeman fields.<br />

## Projective Symmetry Induced Berry Curvature Effects in Space and Time Inversion Invariant Crystals <br />

<!--We discovered non-centered inversion symmetries in the momentum space from projective
symmetry algebras, identified and characterized novel twisted inverse topological edge
states with off-centered crossing points in the momentum space, distinct from edge
states protected by the normal inversion symmetry. Designed topological circuits to
simulate the nontrivial states.

We explore the plane group $$P_{2}$$ and space group $$C_{i}$$ under projective representations while maintaining time-reversal symmetry. Our investigation reveals various Berry curvature effects induced by the projective symmetry algebra. In a 2D system with both inversion and time-reversal symmetries, the Berry curvature universally vanishes in the Brillouin zone.

However, when the inversion symmetry is projectively represented, finite band geometric curvatures emerge, leading to topologically nontrivial valley and edge effects. We design circuit arrays to simulate the topological edge states, which may find potential applications in robust analogue computing devices. 
In 3D, certain magnetic space groups, such as the $$C_{i}$$ group, do not support the emergence of Weyl points. We demonstrate that under projective representations, both charge 2 and charge 1 Weyl points can occur in the $$C_{i}$$ magnetic space group. This suggests that emergent particles in projectively represented magnetic space groups can exhibit distinct characteristics from their normal counterparts. Our work identifies a new research direction in exploring the variety of emergent particles within projective symmetry groups.

## Large Bilinear Magnetoresistance (BMR) from Rashba Spin-Splitting on the Surface of a Topological Insulator <br />
{% include image.html url="/assets/research/rashba-bmr.png" caption="The Rashba state and BMR" width="180px" align="right" %}
We discover Rashba spin-splitting quantum well states developed near the surface of bismuth selenide decorated with transition-metal atoms Cu or Au, which, with the band bending process, explain the observed unusual large BMR in our experiments. We use the semiclassical Boltzmann approach to quantitatively assist our analysis. Our work identifies Cu as a preferential material to engineer bismuth selenide into a Rashba material and demonstrates the BMR as an electrical transport signature to assist the search for inversion asymmetric topological insulator heterostructures with large Rashba spin-splitting. <br />

## Threefold relativistic crossings in moiré heterostructure Bi/FeCl$$_{2}$$ <br />
{% include image.html url="/assets/research/Threefold.png" caption="Threefold reletivistic crossing" width="200px" align="right" %} 
Our experiment discovered a relativistic crossings at K point of the mini Brillouin zone in a moiré structures formed by several layers of Bismuth on top of a FeCl$$_{2}$$ substrate. We developed a theoretical effective model combined with first-principle calculations to elucidate the origin of the moiré-induced threefold relativistic particles. We highlighted that the threefold degeneracy in our experiment is due to the band warping effect for the surface bands at Fermi level.
