## Internships
- Research intern, MindQuantum, Huawei, 10.2023-12.2023. *Topics:* Materials and atoms simulation with quantum circuits using [MindQuantum ](https://gitee.com/mindspore/mindquantum) (Similar like [Qiskit](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/qiskit)). [Here](https://gitee.com/leo-phys/mindquantum/blob/education/homework/Leo/homework_BinbinLIU.ipynb)
<!--(https://github.com/LIU-Binbin/mindquantum/blob/education/homework/Leo/homework_BinbinLIU.ipynb)--> is Python script where I applied quantum circuit to simulate a Hamiltonian of Hydrogen molecules.

- Research intern, North Carolina State University, 03.2019-10.2019. *Topics:* [Anatomy of Nucleon Self-energy from Instant to Light-Front](https://crjiresearchgroup.wordpress.ncsu.edu/group-meetings/archives-liu-binbin/), *advisor:* Dr. Chueng Ji. (Undergraduate thesis project.)
