## Thoughts and wanderings
- AI to learn the exchange correlation functional, only for weakly correlated materials. How to utilize AI in a theoretical framework like the DFT to predict properties within strong correlation regime?

- What will happen to the non-dissipative edge current in a topological insulator when light and heat are applied. Can we find a topological insulator material with such edge current under room-temperature? Implemening novel theoretical frameworks describing electron excitations into HTP calculations (assited with AI) is needed. 

- Alternatively, use HTP screening combined with AI to predict RT superconductors.

- Be able to use quantum computers. [QuEra](https://www.quera.com)'s 256-quibits [aquila](https://www.quera.com/aquila) is available. The [analog quantum mode](https://www.quera.com/neutral-atom-platform) can be less errorness compared of the traditional digital quantum mode. The former requires a higher precision level of controlling the atoms, which is promising in the fault tolerant quantum computing era. So it might be good to start learning how to use quantum simulations/algorithms to study problems, like materials.
